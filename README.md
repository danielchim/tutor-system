# Tutor system
This is the monorepo for COM2103 group project

## Getting started

The project contains 2 components:

* Backend: The backend for handling the http requests from frontend powered by spring boot.
* Frontend: Handling the User interface, and making http requests to backend

### Development

#### Frontend:

You can use whatever code editor you want when developing frontend, however you must install these dependencies:
* NodeJS (v16 or above)
* yarn

To start developing, clone the repository and run `yarn install`

* Be sure to DM me for the enviroment file
* The API file is located in backend/
#### Backend:

You're FORCED to install IntelliJ IDEA ultimate (which is free and instant access for students) due to compability concerns. I have no experiences on other IDEs so please don't ask me if you have other issues when using netbeans.
